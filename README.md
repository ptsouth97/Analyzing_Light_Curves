# Analyzing_Light_Curves

* This repository is based on Grant Foster's excellent book [Analyzing Light Curves: A Practical Guide](http://www.lulu.com/us/en/shop/grant-foster/analyzing-light-curves-a-practical-guide/paperback/product-11037112.html)

* His book presents code examples written in [R](https://www.r-project.org/), and I have re-written them for [Python 3.6](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-360/), using the following libraries available with [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads):
   * [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
   * [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
   * [statsmodels](http://statsmodels.sourceforge.net/)

* Atmospheric data used in the examples can be found on [NOAA's Earth System Research Laboratory (ESRL)](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/trends/)
